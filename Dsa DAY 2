Static block and construction
construct are use to initialise the objects.for every class there will be a default construction when ever you create an object construction will be fault the obect will be create and better properties
 constructor for having class name and better properties

example
static block:
      public class q2 {
      public static void main(string[]args){
     Demo d1 = new Demo();
     Demo d2 = new Demo();
}
}
class Demo {
  static {
    system.out.println("static Block");
}

Demo() {
  system.out.println("contructor");
}
Static block:
         stack block will be a create we just static key word.it will call aotomatically no need to call with either class or object

static Method:
           first static method no need to call with object we can directly call with class static will acts as instance an object.
